# smart-todo
This is a smart todo application Which I am making!!
Notifications are not working yet - this is currently experimental, and so that i can learn some JS.

# Features
- Login and registering
- Adding tasks
- Removing tasks(swipe to delete)
- Notifications
- log in/log out

# Usage of AI

The usage of AI is only for explaining the hash system and how to use render

**Disclaimer**
Enable chrome notifications if you want notificaitons

The UI is not so good, but the website is working. I will reship once the UI is better.
